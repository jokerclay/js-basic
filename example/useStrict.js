// you can also put strict mode in a individual function by putting 
// 'use strict'; in the first line of a function
function print()

// Strict Mode would turn the warning INTO Error
//  IN normal JavaScriprt , when you mistypoing a variable name, it will turn
//  the local variable into the Gloabal  variable, it still can be run 
//  BUT in the strict mode, that is a error;
